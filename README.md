# Linda's Travel Agency

This is my first attempt at designing a website.

## Getting Started

Much like a new driver has a "Student Driver" sign in their car's back window, my website comes with a similar warning.  The intent for the user is to connect to the index page.  From the index page the user can go to the register page to submit a form or the contact page to see how to contact travel agents.

### Prerequisites
